Preliminary Narrative:
This is an experience where the user (the audience) goes through a series of text-based adventures in search of their conscience. At the beginning, the audience (namely the player) gets placed in a “hallucinatory” state with no context of what’s going on. They are given a prompt, some items, and a note. Based on the scenario, they are presented with options they face in this state. Their job is to escape from this psychological horror and enter into reality. The controller has to find a “code” in each web page that will give them an endpoint URL to reach their ending (in our case, another html file for the end).
