                <h2>Welcome to the Unknown</h2>
                <h3 style="font-weight:100;">2022. There has been reports of people going missing after they stumbled upon a mysterious web page on the internet. Official police reports say that all of the victims' neighbors complained about the unexpected loud sounds that occur in their house at random times. Some of the victims disappeared after a few minutes of visiting the site, but no more than 3 minutes. This can't be a coincidence. Rumour has it that each of the victims were accompanied by a man with a black face mask in a black suit and red tie. Security footage shows that the unknown men accompanied their victims out of their homes and never came back. However, there were similar reports that people experienced something similar and they returned alive. The survivors claimed that they had to escape a maze. Some were lucky enough to be alive. Others, however, are still M.I.A.
