            Try hovering and clicking over the words. In some cases, one the words would <span class="clue clue-intext">blink</span> up, or it might not have any  <span class="clue">visual</span> indicators except a cursor change. In both cases (on click), a ping sound will play. Other times, it's just a puzzle.
