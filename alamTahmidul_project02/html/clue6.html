            Try hovering and clicking over the words. In some cases, one the words would <span class="clue clue-intext">blink</span> up, or it might not have any visual indicators except <span class="clue">a cursor change</span>. In both cases (on click), a ping sound will play. Other times, it's just a puzzle.
