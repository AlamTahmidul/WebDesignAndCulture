Narrative:
This is an experience where the user (the audience) goes through a series of text-based adventures in search of their conscience. At the beginning, the audience (namely the player) gets placed in a “hallucinatory” state with no context of what’s going on. They are given a prompt, some items, and a note. Based on the scenario, they are presented with options they face in this state. Their job is to escape from this psychological horror and enter into reality. However, their journey will not be easy. They will have cryptic hallucinations and they may enter a realm of unknown possibilities. Amongst a case of random events occurring, can the user find their way out?
